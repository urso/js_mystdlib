js_mystdlib
===========

just some additional javascript functions and AOP support i like to use in some projects.

The sources contains valid 'jsdoc toolkit' ( http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit ) 
markup. Given that you've setup the jsdoc its 'jsrun.sh' script you can create
the API documentation by running

    $ ./mkdoc.sh
